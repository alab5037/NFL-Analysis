One of the biggest criticisms regarding the New Orleans Saints' offense is their lack of wide receiver options outside of 2019 Offensive Player of the Year Michael Thomas. Luckily for Saints' fans like me, this area has been addressed by the signing of Emmanuel Sanders back in March—or has it? To answer this question, I dive into play-by-play (PBP) data to explore every single pass play from the Saints' 2019 season. Spoiler: Emmanuel Sanders is just what the Saints need—get excited Who Dat Nation!

For this analysis, I use data provided by Max Horowitz on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016).
